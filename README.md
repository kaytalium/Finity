# Finity Inventory (FI)

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate our knowledge of PHP to create an inventory management system. 

The development approach can be seen [Here](docs/approach.md)

The system should support an interface to allow user interaction, see objectives A through G.  

## Project Objective

#### Objective A 
Admin personnels shall be able to log in and perform the following tasks:
* Create user accounts
* Delete user accounts (Physically remove from database)
* Suspend user accounts (make the account inactive)

 #### Objective B
The system should also support a client login which authorizes the client to perform the following tasks:
* Make updates to their user account
* Perform the following inventory actions: 
    * add inventory
    * update inventory

The details for each inventory item should include:
* Item description 
* Quantity
* Unit cost along with other pertinent information.

#### Obective C
The database construction should conform to 3NF regulations and should demonstrate the modelling of relationships in the inventory database.

#### Objective D
The system should also implement any one (1) management report that will enable the organization to take strategic actions. This functionality is available to the authorized user.

#### Objective E
The system should also have an interface which enables the user to make adhoc queries with respect to the database.

#### Objective F
Perform research on any emerging trends with respect to creating PHP interfaces(5 years or less) and use this knowledge to add luster to your user interface.
#### Objective G
Use the concepts of Sessions and Cookies to make the system more functional and robust
